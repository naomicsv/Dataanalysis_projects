### Digitaleydrive data analysis projects
Hello everyone, my name is Adelu Naomi and I took a beginner data analysis course, and it was very educative and challenging, so now i am going to explain my projects
## Global superstores
for me this was the easiest out of all the datasets and the first that i worked on. I used only PowerBi for this set, in my power query editor the only thing i did was duplicate the date column then i split the duplicate into two columns only one containing the year and the other was deleted.Then i went on to make visuals, I answered question 1-3 on page 1 of my visual and the remaining questions on the second page, I had a problem answering question number 7 because i ran out of ideas, but i hope question 1-6 are good enough
